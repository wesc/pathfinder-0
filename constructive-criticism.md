# MapsMap Hackathon Constructive Criticism

I'll break this criticism into two broad categories: of the prize
funding mechanism, and of the technology tree idea itself.


## Funding Mechanism

I have at this point participated in countless hackathons. The most
memorable was spent sleeping with the dinosaurs at the American Museum
of Natural History! I've recently won some bounties:

- https://blueskyweb.org/blog/satellite (winner with Devigny, a zero
  knowledge identity linking scheme)

- https://medium.com/@wesc/status-capture-and-institutional-design-e854492152ae
  (runner up to a Balaji 1729 essay competition)

and I have an upcoming grant for working on decentralized tech:

  (Interplanetary File Catalog)

Also, a hackathon project of mine from over 10 years ago received seed
funding to continue development. Point is, I'm no stranger to how
these things work.

As someone who has been very interested in retroactive public goods
funding, open source funding, and prize mechanisms, I thought it would
be a good idea to dive into MapsMap to get a taste of what it would be
like working towards a sizable prize ($30k at the time of
announcement, later upped to $60k).

$60k is very generous. That said, it's in the unfortunate uncanny
valley of seriousness.

- it's great for an ad-hoc team

- it's too small for a professional team if there's a risk they won't
  win

- it's too small to seek funding like teams do with the X-Prize

- it's too big to encourage small experiments

A winning project should require 100+ hours of work, and if there is
only one winner then the majority of projects, including many that
have sunk in 100 hours, net out zero. What's more, the likelihood a
single developer wins is low, especially one who is employed full time
and has family obligations (NB: that's me!).

If there are ten serious entries and you need at least 100 hours of
work, then that works out to an expected value of $60 / hour, and an
upper end of perhaps $600 / hour. As a professional developer who
happens to have the time to pursue such a thing, that dollar rate
doesn't seem better than doing a guaranteed $200 / hr gig.

A $60k prize also signals that participants should consider
reorganizing their life.

The vast majority of the total hours going into the competition is
either developing overlapping ideas, or will eventually be thrown
away.

In short, this competition structure is optimizing for ad hoc teams
and produces a large amount of wasted effort, especially if there's
little variance on the desired result: to have a system that edits a
knowledge graph.

If the point in the MapsMap Hackathon is to encourage creativity,
experimentation, and sprout ideas the organizers may not have
considered, then there should be many small prizes, and one large
grand prize.

If the point in the MapsMap Hackathon is to develop a well formed
idea, then MapsMap should just have just hire a professional
development team with the $60k.

Furthermore, it's generally the case that Hackathons are a "young
person's game." If the MapsMap team wants experienced participants,
providing a reasonable space with respect to time commitments is
essential.


## Technology Trees

It's a neat idea. I absolutely love it. However, the major problem is
that the inspiration comes from Civ, a game that has the benefit of
historical 20-20. As Kierkegaard says, life can only be understood
looking backwards, but it must (unfortunately) be lived forwards. I
suspect that we can not come up with forward looking maps with a good
degree of accuracy and specificity.

I think the best pro-MapsMap argument is the DARPA funding system,
which relies on program managers with deep knowledge of academia and
industry who can fund technological progress bigger than any
particular research group or company. These plans, though, are
unlikely nodes and edges. Rather, they're broad speculative roadmaps,
perhaps reasoning from first principles.

A popular example within the Foresight community might be Feynman's
_Plenty of Room at the Bottom_, where he reasons his way to
nanotechnology and presents some potentially breakthrough
challenges. There is a kind of map here, but it's a very sparsely
populated one. It is not detailed, and in fact it's communicated
clearly via the original speech he gave. Where are the nodes and
edges? Rather, _Plenty of Room_ is more like pointing to the moon and
saying "in principle we should be able to get there."

A major benefit to a map is legibility. There is no compendium of
DARPA roadmaps. There should be! The ability to open up a page and
point to a roadmap enables funders and pioneers to be convinced that a
thing might be possible.

Along with legibility also comes a Schelling point that pioneers can
focus on, like dogs to fire hydrants. Those that go along with the
focal points are more likely to cooperate and survive. But I need to
ask -- does this necessarily mean these maps are describing the best
solutions we have? Is it the case that the road to a deep solution can
necessarily be written down, or do we risk derailing progress with
overconfident maps?

A good maps system, then, needs to strike a balance by providing
enough specificity that a thing might be possible, but also not narrow
pioneers' focus so much as to miss real solutions. It's unclear to me
if there's a piece of software than can achieve this, or if this
ultimately comes down to the design and culture of a larger complex
social system. I suspect the latter.
